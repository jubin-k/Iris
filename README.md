# Iris
### Iris flower classification

Iris flower is classified into 3 types.Iris-setosa,Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.
The dataset contains input datas such as sepal length,sepal width,petal length and petal width in cm.
Based on these values,we have to predict the type of Iris flower it belongs to.
After being done with data cleaning,the data is splitted into input 'x' and output 'y' which is then splitted into train data and test data followed by normalization and ML model creation.
Confusion matrix is plotted to compare the predicted output with test output,from which the accuracy score of 97.8% is obtained
